The regex patterns can identify: 

email addresses, 
URLs, 
phone numbers, 
credit card numbers, 
time (12-hour or 24-hour format), 
HTML tags, 
Hashtags, 
currency amounts.

HOW IT SHOULD WORK

We feed in a block of text (like an API response)
Each regex Pattern searches for a specific data type
The matches are neatly printed to the terminal.
